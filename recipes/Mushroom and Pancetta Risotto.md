Adapted from [RICARDO](https://www.ricardocuisine.com/en/recipes/6394-mushroom-and-pancetta-risotto)

Servings: 6

# Ingredients

## Mushrooms

- 225 g white mushrooms, sliced
- 225 g variety fresh wild mushrooms, sliced
- 150 g sweet or spicy pancetta, diced
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 45 ml flat-leaf parsley, chopped

## Risotto

- 1.5 litres chicken broth
- 14 g dried porcini mushrooms, crushed
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 60 ml butter
- 500 ml arborio rice
- 250 ml white wine
- 40 g grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
- Mozarella (optional)

# Directions

## Mushrooms

- Cook the pancetta on high heat, remove when cooking leaving behind the oil.
- Add a bit more oil to the pan, and cook the mushrooms. Add the pancetta back to the pan when the mushrooms are done and remove from heat.

## Risotto

- In a saucepan, bring the broth and dried mushrooms to a boil. Reduce the heat and keep warm.
- In a large saucepan over medium heat, soften the onion in half the butter. Add the rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring to coat well. Add the white wine and reduce until almost dry.
- Over medium heat, add the broth, about 250 ml (1 cup) at a time, stirring frequently until the liquid is completely absorbed before adding more broth. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 18 to 22 minutes or until the rice is al-dente. Add broth, as needed. Add two-thirds of the sautéed mushrooms and cook for about 1 more minute.
- Take off the heat and add the Parmesan cheese and the remaining butter. Stir until the texture is very creamy. Adjust the seasoning.
- Tear the mozarrella into small pieces and briefly stir into the risotto.
- Serve the risotto in bowls and garnish with the remaining sautéed mushrooms and the parsley.

# Notes

- Cut and prepare the mushrooms before starting to cook. Cooking is pretty busy.
- Keeps well overnight.
