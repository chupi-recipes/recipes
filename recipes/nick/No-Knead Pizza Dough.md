# Jim Lahey's No-Knead Pizza Dough

Adapted from [serious eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/jim-laheys-no-knead-pizza-dough-recipe)

Servings: 4

# Ingredients

- 500 all-purpose flour
- 1g (1/4 teaspoon) dry active yeast
- 16g (2 teaspoons) fine sea salt
- 350g (1 1/2 cups) water

# Directions
- In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend flour, yeast, and salt. Add water and, with a wooden spoon or your hands, mix thoroughly.
- Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rise at room temperature (about 72°F/22°C) for 18 hours or until it has more than doubled. It will take longer in a chilly room and less time in a very warm one.
- Flour a work surface and scrape out the dough. Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them: For each portion, start with the right side of the dough and pull it toward the center; then do the same with the left, then the top, then the bottom. (The order doesn’t actually matter; what you want is four folds.) Shape each portion into a round and turn seam side down. Mold dough into a neat circular mound. The mounds should not be sticky; if they are, dust with more flour.

# Notes
- If you don’t intend to use the dough right away, wrap the balls individually in plastic and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Return to room temperature by leaving them out on the counter, covered in a damp cloth, for 2 to 3 hours before needed.
