# Chicken Paella

Adapted from [The Spanish Chef](https://www.thespanishchef.com/recipes/chicken-paella)

Servings: 4
# Ingredients
- 4 chicken legs
- 120 ml extra virgin olive oil
- 1 red pepper
- 200 g mange tout
- 1 tomato, grated
- 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 0.4 g saffron
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- Salt to season
- 440 g Spanish rice
- 2 litres chicken stock
# Directions
- Infuse the saffron in the chicken stock. Keep warm over the lowest heat.
- Place your paella pan over medium heat with the olive oil and fry the seasoned chicken legs for 10 minutes until lightly browned. Add the peppers and fry them with the chicken for a further 5 minutes so all sides are caramelised. Stir in the mange tout.
- Add the garlic, closely followed by the smoked paprika and grated tomatoes, cook for about 2 minutes until the oil starts separating from the tomato paste. Add the rice and stir all together for a couple of minutes, making sure the rice gets coated with the oil and sears.
- Carefully add the hot stock to the pan and give it a good stir, distributing the rice evenly. Taste the stock and adjust seasoning if necessary. Cook on high heat for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook for 8 minutes without stirring. Finally, let it rest off the heat for 5 minutes before eating.
# Notes
- Don't stir the paella after putting the stock in. We want the paella at the bottom of the burn to burn a little (socarrat). For this reason no need to add all the stock at the beginning either, you can gently add in later.
- A paella without vegetables is a sad paella.
